        <t>
            This document describes an algorithm and a protocol to
            automate DNSSEC multi-signer <xref target="RFC8901" /> "Multi-Signer DNSSEC Models" setup,
			operations and decomissioning.
            It primarily deals with Model 2 of the Multi-Signer specification, where each operator has their own distinct KSK and ZSK sets (or CSK sets).
            It makes use of <xref target="RFC8078" /> "Managing DS Records from the Parent via CDS/CDNSKEY"
			and <xref target="RFC7477" /> "Child-to-Parent Synchronization in DNS" to accomplish this.

        <t>
            <xref target="RFC8901" /> describes the necessary steps and API for a multi-signer
            DNSSEC configuration. In this document we will combine <xref target="RFC8901" /> with
            <xref target="RFC8078" /> and <xref target="RFC7477" /> to define a fully
            automatable algorithm for setting up, operating and decomissioning of a multi-signer
            DNSSEC configuration.
        </t>
        <t>
            One of the special cases of multi-signer DNSSEC is actually the secure change of DNS operator.

            <t>
                In order for any multi-signer group to give consistent answers across all nameservers,
                the data contents of the zone also have to be synchronized (in addition to infrastructure records like NS, DNSKEY, CDS etc). This content synchronization is out-of-scope
                for this document.

            <t>
                As described in <xref target="RFC8901" /> a multi-signer DNSSEC configuration
                has some challenges that can be overcome with the right infrastructure and
                following a number of steps for setup and operation.
            </t>
            <t>
                In this document we describe how all of the steps in the multi-signer DNSSEC setup
                can be automated. That is, all except the initial trust between involved signers.

            <name>Secure change of name server operator</name>
            <t>
                Changing the name server operator of a DNSSEC signed zone can be quite a challenge.
                Currently the most common method is temporarily "going insecure". This is a bad choice for security,
                and a bad choice for users relying on the security of the zone.
            </t>
            <t>
                Changing name server operators can be considered to be a transient special case of
                multi-signer DNSSEC operations. A new operator joins the old operator in a temporary
                multi-signer setup. Once that is completed, the old operator leaves the multi-signer setup.

                The zone is already authoritatively served by one DNS operator and is DNSSEC signed.
                For full automation both the KSK and ZSK or CSK must be online.
            </t>
            <t>

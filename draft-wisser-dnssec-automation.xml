        <t>
            <xref target="RFC8901" /> describes the necessary steps and API for a Multi-Signer
            DNSSEC configuration. In this document we will combine <xref target="RFC8901" /> with
            <xref target="RFC8078" /> and <xref target="RFC7477" /> to define an 
            automatable algorithm for setting up, operating and decomissioning of a Multi-Signer
            DNSSEC configuration.
        </t>
        <t>
            One of the special cases of Multi-Signer DNSSEC is actually the secure change of DNS operator.
            Using Multi-Signer Model 2 the secure change of DNS operator can be accomplished.

            <t>
                In order for any Multi-Signer group to give consistent answers across all nameservers,
                the data contents of the zone also have to be synchronized (in addition to infrastructure records like NS, DNSKEY, CDS etc). This content synchronization is out-of-scope
                for this document.

            <t>
                As described in <xref target="RFC8901" /> a Multi-Signer DNSSEC configuration
                has some challenges that can be overcome with the right infrastructure and
                following a number of steps for setup and operation.
            </t>
            <t>
                In this document we describe, except for the initial trust, how the steps in the Multi-Signer DNSSEC setup
                can be automated.

            <name>Secure Nameserver Operator Transistion</name>
            <t>
                Changing the nameserver operator of a DNSSEC signed zone can be challenging.
                Currently the most common method is temporarily "going insecure". This is poor for security,
                and for users relying on the security of the zone.
            </t>
            <t>

		Multi-Signer DNSSEC Model 2 provides a mechanism for transitioning from one nameserver operator to another
		without "going insecure". A new operator joins the current operator in a temporary
		Multi-Signer group. Once that is accomplished and stable the old operator leaves the Multi-Signer group completing
		the transistion.
